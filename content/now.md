Devastated about the results of the US election. Radically changing my news consumption patterns and trying to rebuild trust in humans again. Using this winter to hole up with good books and move forward on long dormant projects. This is part distraction, part preparation for a chaotic 2025. 

Moving this personal site from [omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol/) to a static site built by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on [Github Pages](https://github.com/nibtobits/nibtobits). While this setup is more complex, text files and git repos are more familiar to me. I am hoping that the change will encourage me to write in public more. 

Finally jumped on the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) bandwagon after a long stretch of time using homegrown tools for note taking.  

Trying to figure out what I think about AI. Is it useful? It is ethical? I began from a place of skepticism, but am trying to be open minded.
