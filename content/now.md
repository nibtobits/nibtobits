Waiting patiently for August, when several big projects at work are supposed to kick off. Hoping to put in a couple of weeks of deep, focused work before my quick trip to San Francisco for the SF Pen Show in late August. Anxious about hurricanes and the general state of the world. 

Trying to relax by building up my writing skills. While I write daily in my journal, I want to start writing somewhere in public in order to force myself to take my writing all the way from rambling mess to a cohesive and edited form. Playing around with tools and processes to see what works.
